## Black Thursday

Find the [project spec here](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown).

Black Thursday is an app for managing an online store. Customers, Items, Merchants, and Invoices are stored as .CSV files in the /data/ folder. Use ./lib/sales_engine.rb to manage the collections or to query individual entities. Use ./lib/sales_analyst.rb to perform calculations on the data, such as revenue generated by a selected merchant, or the customers who return the most items.
